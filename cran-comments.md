## Firs-time submission
This is the first-ever submission of combiroc package to CRAN

## Test environments
* win-builder (via devtools::build() in RStudio)
* ubuntu 16.04 LTS (via Travis-ci)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Additional Note
Some warnings are intentionally generated by the combiroc::marker_distribution() function, thus warnings_are_errors was set as false (in Travis build check). There were no other warnings other than those programmed.
